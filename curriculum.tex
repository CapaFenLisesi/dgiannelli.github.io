\cvline{Grade}{103/110}
\cvline{Thesis}{\small{\emph{Bosons in a harmonic trap: Bose-Einstein condensation and a Path Integral Monte Carlo algorithm}}}
\cvline{Supervisor}{\small Ettore Vicari, professor at Universit\`a di Pisa}
\cvline{Description}{\small I discussed the Bose-Einstein Condensation in a system of non interacting bosons affected by a harmonic potential. I showed that the partition function of the system could be expressed in terms of Feynman Path Integrals. Considering a Path Integral in Statistical Mechanics as a weighted sum of paths, I presented a method to sample the paths corrisponding to the positions (or momenta) of bosons}

\section{Programming experience} 
\cvline{C/C++}{\small I studied C language in university, as it is part of the program of my Bachelor's Degree. Then, I studied C++ to write object-oriented programs and make usage of ROOT (CERN) libraries}
\cvline{FORTRAN~90}{\small I've used FORTRAN 90 language and OpenMP and MPI on top of it to write parallel PDE solvers, Linear Algebra operations and Monte Carlo simulations}
\cvline{Python}{\small I've used Python for scripting, Python Scientific packages (Numpy, SciPy) to perform quick-to-write computations, Matplotlib for 2D plotting
and Mayavi for 3D plotting}
\cvline{Git}{\small I've a good knowledge of Git VCS, and, throught my university experience, I've got experience in collaborating with other people on the same project}
\cvline{OS}{\small I've got experience in Linux based operative systems, especially Arch Linux based and Debian based, and I've confidence with Bash shell commands}
\cvline{Others}{\small I've got experience in text editing with VIM, typesetting with \LaTeX, auto-building with Makefile, symbolic computing with Wolfram Mathematica, and plotting with Gnuplot}

\section{Other courses and achievements}
\cventry{2015}{High Performance Scientific Computing}{University of Washington}{Coursera MOOC}{\textcolor{blue}{\href{https://www.coursera.org/course/scicomp}{Link}} to course page}
{\small After an introduction to Unix like shell, Git, Python, FORTRAN 90, makefile, OpenMP and MPI FORTRAN API, this online course aims to teach how to write parallelized programs to solve typical scientific computing problems such as Linear Algebra optimizations, PDE solving and Monte Carlo simuations. During this course, there were homeworks and project assignments, but there wasn't a final exam}

\cventry{2015}{Statistical Mechanics, Algorithms and Computation}{\'Ecole Normale Sup\'erieure}{Coursera MOOC}{\textcolor{blue}{\href{https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-mechanics}{Link}} to course page}
{\small This online course is an introduction to Monte Carlo algorithms and their applications in Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Statistical Mechanics using the Path Integral and Density Matrix framework. At the end of this course, an exam was scheduled, and I completed it as it is stated in this coursera.org \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://dgiannelli.github.io/coursera_smac.pdf}{Certificate}}}

\cventry{2010}{First Certificate in English}{University of Cambridge}{}{}{I took this exam when I was in high school, and it certificates the Council of Europe Level B2 in English}
